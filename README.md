# Application Repository

This document provides instructions on how to pull the application from the repository using best practices, as well as the dependencies required to run the application and how to execute it.

## How to Pull the Application from the Repository

To pull the latest version of the application, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**: 
   Make sure you are in the directory where you want the project to reside.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
Navigate into the project directory:

cd your-repo-location
Ensure you are on the correct branch (replace main with the branch you need):

git checkout main
Pull the latest changes:

git pull origin master
Dependencies to Run the Application
Make sure the following dependencies are installed before running the application:

Ruby version 2.7.5
OpenSSL@1.1
Ruby on Rails version 5
Ensure Bundler is Working
Bundler is required to manage the project's gems. You can check if Bundler is installed by running:

bundler -v
If Bundler is not installed, you can install it using:

gem install bundler
How to Execute the Application
Once the repository has been pulled and dependencies are met, follow these steps to run the application:

Install required gems: Make sure all gems are installed by running the bundle install command:

bundle install
Start the Rails server: After installing the gems, you can start the Rails server by running:

rails s
Access the application: Once the server is running, open your web browser and navigate to:

http://localhost:3000
That's it! You should now have the application up and running locally.
